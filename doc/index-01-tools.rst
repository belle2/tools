Installation and Setup
======================

The Belle II Software is meant to work on any recent 64 bit Linux system but it is only
tested and provided in binary form for a few select distributions

.. include:: supported-distributions.rst-fragment

If you run on one of these distributions the most convenient way to obtain the
Belle II Software is to use it via CVMFS_, which is readily available on KEKCC and
many HEP specific software resources.  It can also easily be installed on your
local machine following the `CVMFS Client Quick Start`_ guide.

.. note:: In the following it is assumed that you have configured your `access to the code repository`_

If you have CVMFS available, please continue with

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   cvmfs_setup

If you want to install the Belle II Software without CVMFS please have a look at
the following documents:

.. toctree::

   installation-tools
   installation-local

Alternatively you can use a docker container to get the Belle II software
(instructions `here <https://xwiki.desy.de/xwiki/bin/view/BI/Belle%20II%20Internal/Software/Software%20CodeManagement/Software%20SoftwareInstallation/How%20to%20run%20basf2%20on%20a%20laptop/>`_),
for example on Mac or Windows machines.

If you want to use the Belle II software in a virtual environment, please have a look at the
``b2venv`` documentation.
